## Assignment 2
Create this game in Processing:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Qx0Z3MS3Lzg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0Z3MS3Lzg)

Your game must include the following features:
- A splash screen, game screen and game over screen
- Player left and right movement
- Black blocks that move from right to left. If the player collides with one of the black blocks, they will loose a life. These should have random y positions. Ideally these should be evenly spaced
- When the number of lives goes to 0, it is game over.
- Random yellow blocks. If the player collides with one of these, they should gain a point.
- The game should speed up hence becoming more difficult as it goes on.

You should use the following features of Processing
- Variables, arrays
- Classes
- Loops
- Drawing primitives
- The if statement
- User input

Marking scheme:
- 50% of the marks for this assignment are for implementing the core game as presented in the video
- To get the remaining 50% of the marks you have to come up with your own additions to te core game. Some suggestions:
	- Power up blocks that speed up or slow down the gameplay
	- Extra life blocks
	- Additional gameplay. For example, the ability to shoot blocks
	- Sprites and nice graphics and sound
	- Running on an Android Phone or Raspberry Pi
	- Control with a Kinect, XBOX Controller or Leap Motion
	- Different types of block behaviours instead of just falling 
	- Any other crazy ideas you can come up with your self

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. You will not get any marks for any code that include that you get from books or from the internet. This assignment is about testing what *you* have learned and what *you* can do.
- The date for submission is Monday 20 February 2017
- All assignment submissions must be demoed in the lab that week.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you must submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.

# Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

In your christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays
- Any other cool stuff you have taught yourself in Processing 

Marking scheme:

| Complexity | Code | Visuals | Jazz |
|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some simple interactivity such as a game. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Methods. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
