##Lab
### Learning Outcomes
- Sign up for the class Slack
- Enroll on Webcourses
- Become familiar with the syntax of Processing
- Become familiar with writing and running sketches in Processing

Firstly, go to [https://gp-2016-2017.slack.com](https://gp-2016-2017.slack.com) and sign up for the slack with your DIT email address. Make sure you *click create an account* rather than try and login with your DIT credentials. When you are signed up, send a little greeting to everyone on the #general channel. If you have a smartphone, you might want to install the Slack app. It's free. Also if you install the app, you will probably want to disable certain notifications, otherwise your phone will be buzzing every time someone posts anything. [Here is an article that explains how to do this](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201649323-Channel-and-group-notification-preferences).

Log onto Webcourses and enroll on the module GAME1003. To do this, search the module catalog for GAME and you will see it's the second option.

Look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* noStroke
* noFill
* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size
* arc
* triangle

Write processing sketches to draw the following shapes:

I find it much easier to work out the coordinates by drawing out the shapes on paper first! Try experimenting with different colours

# Week 2
- [Program with the moving rectangle](processing/rectangle)
- [Program that draws a spiral](processing/variables)
- [Using variables in processing](https://processing.org/examples/variablescope.html)

## Lab

### Learning Outcomes
- Learn how to analyse a problem and figure out a solution
- Practice drawing in processing
- Practice using variables
- Practice using operations

Here is a video of a sketch you can make today:

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uvPVGiU-bn4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPVGiU-bn4)

What is happening:

- The ground takes up half the window size
- The spaceship is 100 pixels wide and is *centered* around the mouse position.
- The person starts at the right side of the screen and moved from right to left

Use variables wherever practical in your sketch and calculate positions and sizes relative to these variables.

Bonus!

There are few things you can try (but you will probably have to read ahead and figure out how the if statement works)

- Come up with a more beautiful looking spaceship and person
- Change the colours of everything
- Make a car that drives from left to right
- When the person reaches the left side of the screen, he should switch direction
- Make the lights on the spaceship flash different colours

Post a picture of your creation on the slack.
